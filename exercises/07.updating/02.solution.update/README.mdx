# Update

👨‍💼 Phew 😅 That's a bit of work, but hopefully you're able to follow what's
happening. To re-iterate, what we have so far is:

1. Delete images that are no longer a part of the note
2. Update `altText` for existing images (we're not handling new or changed images yet)
3. Update the note's `title`, `content`, and `images`.

We've gotta handle the new and changed images, and we'll do that in the next.
