# Updating Data

Here's how you insert data into a table in SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

And here's how you would update existing data in SQL:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

And you can even do what's called an "upsert" which is an update or insert
depending on whether the data already exists:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...)
ON CONFLICT (column1)
DO UPDATE SET column2 = value2, column3 = value3, ...;
```

There's more syntax you can use in SQLite to exclude certain columns from the
update, and you can even do an "insert or ignore" which will ignore the insert
if the data already exists.

And finally, you can of course delete data from a table:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## Prisma

Prisma has utilities for all of these operations. We've already used them in the
`seed` script we've written. But here's a quick refresher of all of these
operations:

```ts
// update the rocket with id "1" to have the name "Falcon 9"
await prisma.rocket.update({
	where: { id: 1 },
	data: { name: 'Falcon 9' },
})

// update the rocket with the id "1" to have the name "Falcon 9" if it exists,
// otherwise create a new rocket with the name "Falcon 9"
await prisma.rocket.upsert({
	where: { id: 1 },
	update: { name: 'Falcon 9' },
	create: { name: 'Falcon 9' },
})

await prisma.rocket.delete({
	where: { id: 1 },
})
```

While Prisma with SQLite does not support `createMany`, it does support
`updateMany` and `deleteMany`. So if your `where` clause matches more than one
record, your update will apply every record that matches. However, `upsertMany`
is not supported.

You can also perform nested queries for these as well.
