# Delete

👨‍💼 Huzzah, now when we delete a note it is deleting it from the right database
so we should see it disappear from the list of notes 😅

<callout-info>
	Now that you're able to delete notes, keep in mind you can always restore them
	by re-running the `seed` command: `npx prisma db seed`. You do not need to
	restart the server to see changes.
