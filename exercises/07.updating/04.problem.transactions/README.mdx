# Transactions

🧝‍♂️ I've added a line to the `action` that is gonna cause you some grief. I'm
throwing an error before updating the note to simulate what would happen if
updating the note failed for some reason. Go ahead
and <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId_.edit.tsx" line="151">uncomment it</InlineFile>
and see what happens when you add a new image to a note.

You may not notice right away, but we're creating a new image record without
adding it to the note. If you want to spend some time looking in Prisma Studio,
you'll be able to find an orphan image record. This is a problem because we
don't want to have images in our database that aren't associated with a note or
user.

The problem is that we're not using a transaction. A transaction is a way to
ensure that a series of database operations either all succeed or all fail. If
any of the operations fail, the database will roll back all of the changes.

When you perform a nested query with Prisma, it will automatically wrap the
operation in a transaction. However, we're not using a nested query here. We're
performing separate operations. We need to wrap them in a transaction to ensure
that they all succeed or all fail together.

You can read more about transactions with Prisma in the
[Prisma Transactions Guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide).

Here's how you perform an interactive transaction like we need with Prisma:

```ts
await prisma.$transaction(async $prisma => {
	// Use $prisma instead of prisma in here
	await $prisma.user.create({
		// ...
	})
	await $prisma.team.create({
		// ...
	})
	// etc...
})
```

	Note, the `$prisma` name is not required, but I like calling it that.
</callout-muted>

Please wrap our operations in a transaction to ensure that they all succeed or
all fail together.
