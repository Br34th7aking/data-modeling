# Upsert

An `upsert` is where you say: "If this record exists, update it with this data.
If it doesn't exist, create it, and here's it's data."

In the case of our images, when a user uploads an image, we want to create a new
`File` record if one doesn't exist, or update the existing one if it does.

But one tricky thing about what we have here is we've added a `Cache-Control` on
our <InlineFile file="app/routes/resources+/images.$imageId.tsx" /> route. This
is important for performance reasons, but it also means that if we update the
file represented by that `imageId`, the browser will still be using the old
cached version of the file. Users will be really annoyed.

So if the user updates an existing image, we need to change the `imageId` and
update that in the Note record. We'll use
[`@paralleldrive/cuid2`](https://npm.im/@paralleldrive/cuid2) to generate a new
cuid for the image in that case.

The emoji will guide you in the right direction.
