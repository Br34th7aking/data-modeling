# Update

We need to fix our note edit so we can save edits to our notes in the SQLite
database. This is a tiny bit tricky though because we can't use a nested query
to update the images and the notes all at.

<details>

<summary>Why can't we use a nested query?</summary>

We can't use a nested query because we have some interesting conditions for our
update:

1. If the image has a file:
   a. If the image has an id, update the image
   b. If the image does not have an id, create the image
2. If the image does not have a file:
   a. If the image has an id, update the alt text
   b. If the image does not have an id, do nothing

We also need to delete the images that are no longer in the note.

</details>

So we have to delete the images that aren't in the form submission, then update
the images that are, then update the note. This leads to some issues we'll deal
with later.

So here's what I want you to do, and the emoji in the file will help you:

1. Update the note
2. Delete the images that are no longer in the note
3. Update the images that are in the note

Finally, add `set` to the `prisma.note.update` call so we can set the images
that are in the note (thereby removing deleted ones).

This is much easier when done in a specific order, so we've added number emoji
in the comments to help you know what order to do things in.
