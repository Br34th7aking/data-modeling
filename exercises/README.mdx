# ðŸ’¾ Data Modeling Deep Dive

## Prisma Tips:

- If your database ever gets in a bad state, you can always delete the database
  file itself and prisma will recreate it for you next time you run something.
- [Configure the logs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/logging)
  to enable `query` and other logs and see the SQL queries that Prisma generates
  and other information.
  ```ts highlight=2
  const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  	log: ['query', 'info', 'warn', 'error'],
  })
  ```
