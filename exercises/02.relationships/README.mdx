# Data Relationships

Models in a database often have relationships, like like objects in our code or
even things in real life. There are a few types of relationships. We'll talk
about three of the most common:

## [One-to-one](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/one-to-one-relations)

A person has one social security number, a social security number belongs to one
person. Here's an example of how that could be represented in prisma.

```prisma
model Person {
  id             String          @unique @default(cuid())
  name           String
  socialSecurity SocialSecurity?
}

model SocialSecurity {
  id       String  @unique @default(cuid())
  number   String
  person   Person @relation(fields: [personId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  personId String @unique
}
```

You'll notice the `@relation` attribute on the `SocialSecurity` model. This
configures the relationship between the two models with
[referential actions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/referential-actions).

The `fields` argument specifies which fields in the model are used to refer to
the other model. The `references` argument specifies which fields in the other
model are used to refer to this model. The `personId` field is used to refer to
the `Person` model and is called a _foreign key_.

The `onDelete` and `onUpdate` arguments specify what happens when the referenced
model is deleted or updated. In this case, we're saying that if a `Person` is
deleted or updated, the `SocialSecurity` should be deleted or updated as well.

## [One-to-many](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/one-to-many-relations)

A person has many phone numbers, a phone number belongs to one person. For
example:

```prisma
model Person {
  id           String        @unique @default(cuid())
  name         String
  phoneNumbers PhoneNumber[]
}

model PhoneNumber {
  id       String @unique @default(cuid())
  number   String
  person   Person @relation(fields: [personId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  personId String
}
```

In this case, the biggest difference is that the `personId` field is not
declared as `@unique`. This is because a person can have many phone numbers, so
the same `personId` can appear multiple times in the `PhoneNumber` model.
And on the `Person` model, the `phoneNumbers` field is declared as an array of
`PhoneNumber` models, because a person can have many phone numbers.

## [Many-to-many](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/many-to-many-relations)

A blog post has many tags, a tag has many blog posts. For example:

```prisma
model Post {
  id    String      @unique @default(cuid())
  title String
  tags  TagOnPost[]
}

model Tag {
  id    String      @unique @default(cuid())
  name  String
  posts TagOnPost[]
}

model TagOnPost {
  tagId  String
  postId String
  post   Post   @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  tag    Tag    @relation(fields: [tagId], references: [id])

  @@id([postId, tagId])
}
```

In this case, we have a third model called `TagOnPost` that represents the
relationship between `Post` and `Tag`. This model has two foreign keys, one for
`Post` and one for `Tag`. The `@@id` attribute specifies that the combination of
`postId` and `tagId` should be unique. This is also called a _composite key_.

## Visualizing relationships

Sometimes it can be helpful to represent these relationships visually.
Especially for very complex relationships. This is often done using an _entity
relationship diagram_ or ERD.
[Learn more about ERDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model).

You can even use the [prisma-erd-generator](https://github.com/keonik/prisma-erd-generator)
to generate an ERD from your prisma schema. For example:
