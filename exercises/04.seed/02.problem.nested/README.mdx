# Nested Writes

Check out the code for the first image we're creating:

```ts lines=4-11
const newImage1 = await prisma.image.create({
	data: {
		altText: 'an adorable koala cartoon illustration',
		file: {
			create: {
				contentType: 'image/png',
				blob: await fs.promises.readFile(
					'./tests/fixtures/images/kody-notes/cute-koala.png',
				),
			},
		},
	},
})
```

Notice that we're actually creating two records instead of just one? This is
called a nested query. It's required because the `Image` model has a
`file` field that is a `File` model. We need to create the `File` record first
and then use the `id` of that record to create the `Image` record.

Prisma manages this for us by nesting the queries. This generates more optimal
SQL queries than running multiple queries. It also helps to ensure that if
there's an error we don't have data dangling around without an owner.

And it also manages connecting the foreign keys for us. Without using nested
queries, we have to do that ourselves, which is why we have to update our note
after creating the image:

```ts lines=4-6
await prisma.note.update({
	where: { id: firstNote.id },
	data: {
		images: {
			connect: [{ id: newImage1.id }, { id: newImage2.id }],
		},
	},
})
```

Instead, I want you to nest everything into a single query. It will get a little
nested, and you may feel it's better to break it up into multiple queries.
Luckily that's your prerogative in your own app, but I want you to try it out
first. As mentioned, there are legitimate benefits to nesting these queries.
Also, we'll make it better in the next exercise.

Once you're finished, seed the database again to check your work:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db seed
```
