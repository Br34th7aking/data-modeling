# Migrations

👨‍💼 Great! We can now commit this migration file and as we make changes to the
data model we can continue committing migration files and feel confident that
our production database can follow along.

We won't cover actually deploying this to a production environment in this
workshop, but it really amounts to running `npx prisma migrate deploy` before
during your deployment process. By following the good practices we've gone over,
this should be a non-event.
